## How to customize default label Gadget In Blogger - Cloud?

I've divided the section into two parts: Adding of Label Gadget and Installation of Code.  
  

#### Step 1: Add Default Label Gadget to Blogger

Go to **Blogger Dashboard** â†’ **Layout** â†’ **Add a Gadget** â†’ **Select Label Gadget**.  Now a Label Gadget will pop up. Edit it as,  

> Title: Give your title  
> Show: All Labels/Selected Labels \[Any one option\]  
> Sorting: Alphabetically/By Frequency \[Any one option\]  
> Display: Cloud

_Note: You must select the CLOUD option else this trick won't work._  
  

#### Step 2: Adding CSS Code to Blogger

Before adding the codes,a good habit is to [Backup the blog](http://twistblogg.blogspot.com/2014/05/how-to-backup-all-blogger-blogs-with-google-takeout.html). Once done, Go to **Theme** â†’ **Edit HTML**. Search for `]]></b:skin>` and paste the code just above it. Check editing section on how you can customize label gadget. Once everything is done, click on Save Template.  

```css title=main.css
/* Customize Default Label Cloud Gadget in Blogger By TwistBlogg.com */ 
/* Flat UI Labels Cloud By TwistBlogg.com ---------------- */ 
.sidebar .label-size {  
position:relative;
text-transform: uppercase;  
text-decoration:none;  
font-size:13px;  
font-family:Open Sans;  
color:#fff!important;  
}  
   
.sidebar .label-size a {  
color:#fff!important;  
font-weight:bold;  
padding:8px 10px;  
margin:0 6px 6px 0;  
float:left;  
display:block;  
-moz-transition: all 0.4s ;  
-o-transition: all 0.4s;  
-webkit-transition: all 0.4s ;  
-ms-transition: all 0.4s ;  
transition: all 0.4s ;  
}  
   
.sidebar .label-size-1 a {background:#1abc9c;border-bottom:3px solid #127F69;}  
.sidebar .label-size-1 a:hover {background:#16a085;}  
.sidebar .label-size-2 a {background:#3498db;border-bottom:3px solid #226693;}  
.sidebar .label-size-2 a:hover {background:#2980b9;}  
.sidebar .label-size-3 a {background:#2ecc71;border-bottom:3px solid #1F8C4C;}  
.sidebar .label-size-3 a:hover {background:#27ae60}  
.sidebar .label-size-4 a {background:#9b59b6;border-bottom:3px solid #74398E;}  
.sidebar .label-size-4 a:hover {background:#8e44ad}  
.sidebar .label-size-5 a {background:#e74c3c;border-bottom:3px solid #922C20;}  
.sidebar .label-size-5 a:hover {background:#c0392b}
```
  
**Editing Section,**  

âž¤ Its pretty simple to edit the CSS code.Â To change the background color, modify `background:#hex_value`.Â   
  
âž¤ To change font size, modify `font-size:13px` and for font family, modify `font-family:Open Sans`. I personally feel like `font-family: inherit` will look pretty cool as it make use of default template font family.
