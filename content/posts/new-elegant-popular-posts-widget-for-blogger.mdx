Show off your golden posts with this new elegant style popular posts widget which is designed for blogger users. I have shared my [1st popular posts widget](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/02/stylish-popular-posts-widget-with-count-box.html) to which I am using on this blog (you can see it live hanging into the sidebar) previously in 2 different versions. But this time I have designed another cool professional looking popular posts widget with lovely hover effect and counter box.   



#### Some Features of New Elegant Style Popular Posts Widget  


*   Default Thumbnails used (no JavaScript). 
*   Cool Counter Box Hanging Left Side. 
*   Simple Neat and Clean Design. 
*   Easy Customization. 
*   Cool Hover Effect. 
*   The whole List item is clickable, that means it will be clickable when the mouse is hovered on the list item area and not only by hovering the mouse over the title link or thumbnail like as other widgets. 
*   Using Google fonts.

## Installing New Elegant Style Popular Posts Widget to Blogger


Ready to add? I have used Google font family Oswald (Lovely Font) which gives this widget an elegant look so I recommend you to use this font family. In case you're already using then you can skip this step of adding Google font family to your template.  



### Add Popular Posts Widget to Your Template Sidebar First  


First of all you need to install it from blogger gadgets library.


Go to **Blogger** - **Layout** - click on **Add a Gadget** link into sidebar then add a popular posts widget. In case you have installed it already then skip this step.  
  

#### Change Configuration Settings  


Now just change the configuration settings of newly added popular posts widget where you have to uncheck snippet. See the screenshot below.

### Adding Google Font Family "Oswald" to Your Blogger Blog  


**1)** Go to **Blogger** - **Template** - **Edit HTML** (Save a [backup copy of your template code](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/05/how-to-backup-all-blogger-blogs-with-google-takeout.html) first)  


**2)** Find out this code `<head>` and paste the Google font family link just below this code  

_(Use **Ctrl+F** or **Cmd+F** after clicking inside the template code box to open up a search box for searching your code)_  


```html
<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald|Open+Sans:300italic,400italic,600italic,400,300,600,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'/>
```


### Adding CSS Code to Your Template  


Now all you need to do is add the CSS code of popular posts widget into your template code.  

I have made it for using in the sidebar by adding **.sidebar** class to it, but you can make it work in the footer too. Just change the **.sidebar** class with your footer id or class name.  
  
_**Note:** If you are using any other popular posts widget already for sidebar then you need to remove that CSS code first otherwise it will not work and you will mess up everything._  
  
If you need my help then leave your message in the comment section with your blog URL.  
  
**3)** Find out this code `]]:</b:skin>` and just before that paste the whole CSS code given below as it is.  

```css
