*A Complete Guide on Creating Creative and Stunning Landing Pages For Blogger Without Any Coding Skills for FREE.*


## How to design Landing Pages in Bloggers - No Coding Involved

At first, you'll need to have some account created. Let's get started with what all you need and follow through this tutorial. 

### Pre-Requisites for Designing Landing Pages in Blogger  

OK, let me briefly explain how we are designing our landing page with a powerful Drag-and-Drop Page Builder.

We will create a design in Brizy Cloud *(the page builder service we will be using today)* , upload it to Github *(for hosting our project)* and connect to Netlify *(for website deployment)* . All these for FREE OF COST. Trust Me :)

 1. A Brizy Cloud Account. (<A href="https://www.brizy.cloud/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up now</A>)
 2. Github Account. (<A href="https://www.github.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up now</A>)
 3. Netlify Account. (<A href="https://www.netlify.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up now</A>)

## Designing Our Landing Pages in Brizy Cloud - Step 1

I assume you've created an account in Brizy Cloud and logged in.  You'll have an interface where there's an option to create a New Project. 


<Image src="brizy cloud dashboard for creating landing pages.png" alt="brizy cloud dashboard for creating landing pages" />


Start New Project and Create a "**Website & Landing Page**"  

You've successfully created a project with name *"Project#1"*. You can rename it as well. Here's a snapshot : 


<Image src="creating a project in brizy cloud.png" alt="creating a project in brizy cloud" />


Hover Over that project and Hit **"Edit Project"**.  You will get a blank page with an option of <ins>Start Building Your Page</ins>. This is where we will customize our page design and create something we are planning for.

> **WOW Factor :** There's so many layouts, styles and blocks available for
> FREE. You can drag and drop to start using them. Its as simple as
> that.

*Note: Designing A Whole New Page can make this post super lengthy, therefore, I'll just give a glimpse on some available features. You can follow some online tutorials on how to create one. Here's my recommendation :*


<Block src="singlebutton" variant="accent" text="Watch on YouTube" icon="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BrizyWordPressWebsiteBuilder/playlists" />


Now, Click on + sign and you'll have a full bunch of elements. Go, try and check one that fits your design layout.


<Image src="elements available on brizy cloud.jpg" alt="elements available on brizy cloud" />


You can even start with a Free Layout Page. 


<Image src="free layout pages available on brizy.jpg" alt="free layout pages available on brizy" />


You can set default font family, color, font size and styling by going under **"Styling"** settings from main page. In the same column, you can see option to **reorder blocks**, **add extra elements**, **check for responsiveness** and **upload favicon icon**, **update social links** and other settings for *SEO purpose*.


<Image src="extra setting in brizy for creating landing pages.png" alt="landing page builder for blogger" />


Since, we are using FREE tag in this post, I'll skip Pro features. You can find them on homepage of Brizy.cloud. 

Let's move to another step.


## Uploading Brizy Cloud Project To Github - Step 2

I'm assuming you've a Github account and ready with your brizy cloud landing page web design template. 

Go back to your dashboard by clicking **Three lines > Go to Dashboard**. Hover over your project and you should see **three dots**. Select **Publish** Option. 

Or You can hit **Publish Link** below your project title.


<Image src="publishing brizy cloud project.jpg" alt="publishing brizy cloud project" />


Now, you'll get 4 options as shown below. Select **"3rd party Free Hosting"**.


<Image src="options for publishing project in brizy cloud.jpg" alt="options for publishing project in brizy cloud" />


Select any one of the 4 options available now. I'll go with *"Netlify"*.


**Let's setup Github connection first.** 

Once you click on "Netlify", a popup will appear requesting you to authorize Brizy cloud with Github. **Authorize the application.**


After authorizing, two things happen:

- Brizy Cloud will create and add content to a new repository, named "**brizy-project-some_number**" . You can rename it by clicking on settings option. Its optional.


<Image src="brizy creates a repository on github.png" alt="brizy creates a repository on github" />


- Your Brizy account reflects that github is connected.


<Image src="github is connected reflected in brizy account.jpg" alt="github is connected reflected in brizy account" />


You've successfully uploaded your brizy project to Github. Let's move to last step.


## Deploying Brizy Project to Netlify - Step 3


Netlify is the all-in-one free hosting platform for static websites. Their generous free plan of 100GB/month bandwidth, 300 build time minutes and unlimited site creations is why we are choosing Netlify for deploying our site. 

Go to <A href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netlify.com</A> and login.

Once logged in, click on "**New site from git**" to connect github to netlify.


<Image src="connecting github to netlify for hosting landing pages.jpg" alt="connecting github to netlify for hosting landing pages" />


Now, **select Github** from the available options.


<Image src="Select github as an option.png" alt="Select github as an option" />


A popup will appear requesting for Authorizing Netlify to Github. Click on "**Authorize Netlify**" and you're good to go.


Choose the Github account you want to install Netlify on. *If you are part of an organisation you'll get multiple options,* but you should choose the account you've uploaded your brizy project.

Now, choose "**Only Selected Repositories**" if you've many and select the one with name "brizy-project-some_number" or you can select "**All Repositories**" and hit "***Install***".

After that, you'll be redirected to Netlify account and select the repository name.


<Image src="landing page themes for blogger.png" alt="landing page themes for blogger" />


Hit "**Deploy**" option and your site should be live in a couple of minutes. You'll see <ins>Successfully Connected to Brizy Cloud</ins> message upon success. 


<Image src="hit deploy button in netlify.png" alt="hit deploy button in netlify" />


At this point, your brizy account should reflect "Netlify connected" message.


<Image src="netlify connected to brizy.png" alt="netlify connected to brizy" />


Here you've a working landing page website to use for your blogspot platform. You can rename it or even add Domain/Subdomain. And more importantly, you can use it anywhere.

If you need help with setting up domain name, you can <A href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> check this tutorial. </A>


#### My Landing Page is not showing Up, what to do?

Sometimes, after even performing everything correctly, you'll get **"Failed to connect to Brizy Cloud"** message upon loading your page. You can easily solve this. Let's go back to our <ins>Github account and Brizy-project-some_number</ins> repository.

There you'll see a index.html page. Open that file.


<Image src="githup repo.png" alt="githup repo" />


You'll see a line of code there, something like this:


<Image src="editing code for landing page template.png" alt="editing code for landing page template" />


Copy that link and paste in your browser address bar. You'll now append your site address there. Something like this:

`https://www.brizy.cloud/projects/3116139/sync/publish-methods/deploy-url/update?deploy_url=https://priceless-hawking-c19b63.netlify.app/`

where, `https://priceless-hawking-c19b63.netlify.app/` is my web address. 

Hit enter and you'll see the site is loading properly in a couple of minutes.
