Creating a backup of your one blogger blog is a easy task to do from your blogger dashboard but if you are managing more than one blog on blogger platform then this process might take you several minutes to create backup of your all blogs one by one manually. 

But by using Google Takeout service you can create the backup of your all blogs with one click and download the archive on your desktop instantly or else you can download the backup later as it would not get deleted once it is created. So isn't it useful? For free? :)  
  

  

### Why Should You Create Backup Of Your Blog?

Why? Even I would say you that you should make a regular habit of doing this. The main reason for doing this is that you are [blogging](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/03/blogger-search-preferences-settings-seo.html) on "Blogger" platform where you have no control on your blog hosting as it is provided to you for free. Who knows when your blog might come under "not comply" with blogger's "TOS" and voila, your blog got deleted without any prior notice. Can you feel the pain? 

Suppose you logged in to create a new post and found that there is no existence of your blog like it was never been there ever before. So? Would you get it back anyhow? The answer is BIG NO! No matter how hard you try to convince them in forums. It happened with me before. Although, I was just playing around blogger to learn HTML/CSS and blogging life then :) so it did not hurt me that much. When you have a backup of your blog, you can simply upload your blog to another blogging platform like as WordPress.

**Step 4):** Download the backup to your desktop once it is created. Before letting you download, Google may ask you to re-enter your password so do as it says then your downloading will start. It will be in a ZIP file format so to open these files, you can use any free tool like WinRAR or 7Zip. Search on google for it to download and install.
