#### Extension:

It is strongly recommended that you use a ".Com" domain name extension for your business as it fits the best and [gets rankings in search engines](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/03/seo-top-5-link-building-methods.html) all over the world. 

But in case your Business is Local, then do read 4th Point.


#### As Short As Fits Best:

Keep Your Domain Name as short as possible. The Shorter It Is The Better. Keep a good combination of your name and your business name or Your Goals And Business name. Try Different variations and pick the one which satisfies you. Keep its length up to less than 15 characters.


#### Location or Targeted Area:

If Your Business is Local then consider buying a Top Level Country Domain Name ie. **your-business-name.in** for India or **your-business-name.com.np** for Nepal. Then your website/blog will get higher rankings in that particular country where is your targeted audience.


#### Easy To Type And Remember: 

Now just think of some big players around the web like as Facebook, Wikipedia, and Amazon. Did you get it? These names are simple, short and eye catchy which are easy to type and remember.


#### Use Keywords: 

It is very important [from the point of view of SEO for your domain](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/02/top-5-must-do-seo-things-before-publishing-your-articles.html) name. Try to have a main keyword for your business included in your domain name by which people will use to search online.


#### Avoiding Hyphens or Numbers:

If possible, avoid using hyphens or numbers in your domain name. It works best if there is no hyphen or number in a domain name. But if you got no choice, you can use a hyphen which is far better than not having it at all. Be creative and I bet you would come up with better options available.


#### Protecting Your Brand:

Now if you Have Registered your domain name with a .com or any other extension, now its time to protect your Brand name from your competitors. Because by the time when your business will get popular, competitors will get their hands to steal your audience by registering the same domain name with the other extensions available. So this time, be ready to buy all other major TLDNs and make a redirect to your main domain name. Be safe.


#### Checking For Registered Trademarks: 

Before Registering your domain name for the business, do check if someone already have registered trademarks on that or not. If you are unable to get my point then you must Google "Microsoft vs. MikeRoweSoft" case. Do not infringe the copyrights of other people and stay away from serious trouble.


#### Expanding Capability:

Do not purchase a domain name which makes your business be limited. In future, your business may expand and include a wide range of products. Do not make your blog/website a single product/niche based ie. BabyGirlShoes.com is limited To Baby Girl Shoes so what if you start selling other baby girl products in future?
