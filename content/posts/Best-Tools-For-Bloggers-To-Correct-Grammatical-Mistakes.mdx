### Why Should You Use A Tool For Grammatical Mistakes?  


Whether you are a Blogger or Freelance writer, you will have to take it seriously that your articles do not include most common grammatical mistakes because it affects you in a number of ways:

*   **Authority:** If you are a blogger then it is crucial for you to write grammar error free article because your readers will notice the most common grammar errors you are making. They will not become your readers and next time when they will see your [blog link](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/03/seo-top-5-link-building-methods.html) in search results, they will not click it.

*   **Rankings:** Search engines will notice the grammar errors in your articles while crawling and ultimately your rankings will go down. Your articles will get indexed but never appear in SERPs even on the 2nd page. So it is [important from SEO](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/02/top-5-must-do-seo-things-before-publishing-your-articles.html) point of view

*   **Advertisements:** Why do you blog? To make money along with sharing useful stuff? Then who will opt your blog for advertisements? It will be very difficult to get approved for major ad programs like as Adsense, Infolinks, BuySellads or Individuals.
