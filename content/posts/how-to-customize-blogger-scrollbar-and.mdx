Ever thought about if you could customize the text selection color and browser scrollbar color/width on your blogger blog? You can see the live examples on our blog itself. We have changed its text selection color and scrollbars color & width too. Isn't it nice? :) 

Follow this simple step by step tutorial and do the same on your blog. Make your [blog look more professional](https://www.twistblogg.com/2019/09/display-estimated-post-reading-time-in-blogger-posts.html), eye catchy, user friendly and of course, colorful too.

  

  
## Customization of Scrollbar in Blogger

Default color of scroll bar in every browser is grey which can be customized thoroughly. We can customize our blogger's default scroll-bar by customizing its width, height, scrollbar track color, thumb color, thumb hover color and thumb color when scroll-bar is active. To do so, all we need to do is add these styles to our [blogger template's](https://www.twistblogg.com/2019/09/best-premium-blogger-templates.html) CSS style-sheet. Without further delay, let us do the job.  
  
**Step 1)** Login to your blogger account >> go to Template >> Edit HTML.  
**Step 2)** Click anywhere inside the template code box then press **Ctrl+F** on windows and **Cmd+F** on mac.  
**Step 3)** Find out this little piece of code line `]]></b:skin>` and just before that, paste the whole CSS code given below. You can customize its color codes as you wish.  

```css title=scrollbar.css
/*--------- Scrollbar Customization by TwistBlogg.Com--------- */  
 ::-webkit-scrollbar {  
width:8px;  
height:8px;  
}  
::-webkit-scrollbar-track {  
background:#FFF;  /*------This is background color of scrollbar track ------*/  
-webkit-box-shadow:inset 1px 1px 2px #E0E0E0;  
border:1px solid #D8D8D8;  
}  
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {  
background:#c0392b;  /*------Thumb color ------*/  
-webkit-box-shadow:inset 1px 1px 2px rgba(155,155,155,0.4);  
}  
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {  
-webkit-box-shadow:inset 1px 1px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.4); /*------Shadow on hover------*/  
}  
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:active {  
background:#333;   /*------Thumb color when it is active------*/  
-webkit-box-shadow:inset 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);  
}  
```

**Step 4)** Hit save button :). In the above CSS code, I have added proper comments to change the color codes to make it easy for every one. If you have further questions, follow the comment route, am eagerly waiting to help you do the job :).  
  
**Note:** Please do share your blog URL in comments and I'll personally visit every one's blog to check which colors you have chosen. I'll leave a comment too. Fair enough? huh?  
  

## Customization of Text Selection Color in Blogger



By text selection color, what do I mean is whenever someone selects the text with mouse on your blog post then by default its color. Got it? Default background color is always blue and text color is white. Ready to add some more colors to your blog ?  
  

**Step 1)** Just repeat the previous steps first and find out this `]]></b:skin>` code again.   

**Step 2)** As always, paste the code given below after changing the color codes to match with your blog's theme and hit save button.

  
```css title=text-selection.css
/*--------- Text selection Customization by Twistblogg.Com------------- */  
::selection {  
background:#e67e22; /*------This is the background color on selection-----*/  
color:#fff; /*------This is text color on selection-----*/  
}  
::-moz-selection {  
background:#e67e22;  
color:#fff  
}  
::-webkit-selection {  
background:#e67e22;  
color:#fff  
}
```
