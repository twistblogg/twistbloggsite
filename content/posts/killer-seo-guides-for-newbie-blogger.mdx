### 6] Shouting about my blog and asking for comments   


Why not? You should use social media platforms to announce the establishment of your new blog and what content you've written. I mainly use Google plus to promote it and of course facebook and twitter too. I submitted my webpage url to my blogger friends of same niche and asked them to have a look and tell them to comment if they like my post. And yeah they love that and I get some comments too that will surely inspire me.

**Getting Comments on your blog post also helps to rank on first page of google**. Yeah you've heard it right. The content and blog post with high number of comments is shown first as it is supposed to be relevant content. But don't try to comment yourself with different names and address as google is not as stupid you think it is. Try to be friendly with your users and always feel happy and proud to announce your blog post to your friends and medias.
