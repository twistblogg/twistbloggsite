AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages and it is a framework provided by Google that helps pages load faster on mobile devices. The basic principle of AMP is to lighten the pages by structuring HTML in a common and predefined ways.  
  
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to Wikipedia</a>, AMP frameworks consists of 3 components: 

**AMP HTML**, which is a standard HTML markup with web component;   
**AMP Javascript**, which manages resources loading and,   
**AMP Caches**, which serve and validate AMP Pages.    
  
In this tutorial, I'm going to share best premium and SEO optimized AMP Blogger templates of 2020 with free download link.  


A website which is using AMP Pages will get following benefits compared to non-AMP pages.

### Are AMP templates worth using?

Before I move further, I want to share some information shared by famous bloggers and developers on AMP sites for blogger.  


**\* According to Mohammad Mustafa Ahmedzai (from mybloggertricks)**, AMP sites are not worth using in blogger platform because: 

\- they drastically reduce adsense revenue  
\- there is also no official support from Blogger platform currently.  
\- the so-called AMP templates available in internet are not in fact AMP sites as the codes of a template are forcibly converted to AMP codes, which gives headache in tweaking.  
\- And more errors in Google Search Console.

**\*\* According to an article from The Wall Street Journal,** some publishers were not generating ads revenue as they had hoped for because of the inflexibility of AMP sites for no JavaScript Support and No Blogger Support.

**\*\*\* According to Reddit,**  

If you're a news site then its worth it, if you're doing anything else then its not.  
  
The only advantage to amp is that it makes sure your pages load fast but you should be making sure your pages load fast anyway. All Amp does is strip down your page to the bare essentials to speed it up but then it also adds in unnecessary JS files to enable the carousel. There is also a host of downsides to amp.  
  
If you're not a news publisher, then you can speed up your pages yourself and not worry about the downsides of amp and you'll be in a far better spot.
