I faced this problem, along with a lot of customers who bought domain from GoDaddy. The problem is: I bought my custom domain name from GoDaddy and followed all steps from Google — Added CNAME and A records in Godaddy DNS Management and Redirected naked domain (example.com) to the non-naked domain (www.example.com). 

My custom blogspot address `(twistblogg.blogspot.com)` was redirected successfully to `(www.twistblogg.com)`. All Redirection were working except `(https://twistblogg.com)`. The following table will help summarize my whole point.

### Step 3: Domain Forwarding Service Available in GoDaddy

I had <a href="https://in.godaddy.com/community/Managing-Domains/Domain-Name-Not-working-without-www-in-blogger/m-p/147452#M28381" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">circulated my solution in the godaddy community</a>, and was notified **this issue is handled from server side**, as explained by Nate.

Since blogspot websites are hosted on Blogger.com (A service offered by Alphabet/Google), there is no need to waste bandwidth searching for solution. Google handles this from their side. Previously, I had explained Domain Forwarding is the solution, but enabling this service from Godaddy adds extra "A Records" and the website is loaded randomly either from Godaddy server or Google server.  


**Here is an answer by Nate:**  


> If you have multiple records for the same address, one would be selected randomly each time, so some of your visitors would get one of the Google IP addresses and others would get the GoDaddy forwarding server.  If you are getting a valid SSL it is likely using one of the Google IP addresses, there's about 1/5 chance of getting forwarding instead...



#### So, how to solve domain redirection issue in Godaddy for Blogger?  


_Remove "A" Records and add them again. It will refresh the addresses. Wait for some hours (in most cases, few minutes) and it should solve the redirection problem._
