Good afternoon fellow bloggers, it's been a while I haven’t posted articles, however today I’m back to the track with this amazing blogger template: **Scary Blogger Template**. The name itself suggests the look of the template. It makes use of a scary audio file, which plays in background, and some ghost images to underscore the effect.  
  


Take a look, does that impress you? Well, if yes, then I’m sure your friends will be too, and they may even eulogize you, later on commensurate with some professional bloggers. That’s the aim of this template: to get attention. Let me inform you: _This template does not fit well with any niche specifically, and also it is not an SEO optimized or professional blogger template. It is just a template to show off_.  


**NOTE:-** You do not have permission to COPY and SHARE this template on your blog. Neither you can remove the Credits given in the CSS comments and footer. Respect the hard-work of others'. Play it safe and clean. :)

**\*BONUS:-** We provide a plethora of professional blogger templates, here in TwistBlogg, for zero of cost, and we are adding up a template every week. Don't miss out the chance to surf these _[premium SEO optimized blogger templates](https://www.twistblogg.com/blog/premium-blogger-templates)._

  

### Understanding and Editing the template

Below, I've endeavored to point out on how the template is coded. Basically, it contains three main parts: audio file, background images and texts, hyperlinks. Let's look at each in depth.  
  

#### Section 1: Audio file  
  
This template uses an audio music -- `ScaryLaughExtended.mp3` .  The music is hosted on SoundCloud. You can download and re-upload it.  
  
```html title=audio.html
<div class='son'>  
<iframe width="100%" height="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/655099439&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false&visual=false"></iframe>  
</div> 
```

`auto_play=true` autoplays the audio script in background.

  

##### How to download and upload the audio file in SoundCloud?

  
*   To download the file: Copy the below link and <a href="https://www.klickaud.net/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paste it on this website</a>.  
    
    `https://soundcloud.com/aman-bhattarai-649792689/scarylaughextended`
    
*   To upload the file: **Create an account** in SoundCloud and **log in**.
*   Press the **upload** link present in the right side of search box.
*   **Select the audio file** you have downloaded, and click **upload**.
*   Once done, press **save** and Go to **your profile**, there you can see the tracks you have uploaded.
*   Click on **Share** option, and click on **Embed** Option.
*   Replace the src link from the above code with yours'. Done

#### Section 2: Background images And Editing Chat Box  
  
The template makes use of six background images. Each tab presents a new one. I've provided some files below, and you can host them by yourself.

##### How to change the chat box?

The template provides a chat box to interact with users. However, the chat box I've used is of **Free Plan** and it may **exceed the limitation** at any time. So, I highly recommend you to **create an account** and **paste your code**.  
  

```html title=chatbox.html
_<!-- BEGIN CBOX - www.cbox.ws - v001 -->_  
<div id='cboxdiv' style='text-align: center; line-height: 0'>  
<iframe allow='autoplay' allowtransparency='yes' frameborder='1' height='325' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' scrolling='no' src='https://www6.cbox.ws/box/?boxid=827640&boxtag=2vvrar' width='75%'></iframe>      
</div>
```

*   <a href="https://www.cbox.ws/index" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Go to this website</a>.
*   Create an account, and **choose the plan** accordingly. 
*   **Create a chat box**, and Done !

#### Section 3: Texts and links  


This is not a difficult task. Analyze the texts and change them accordingly by searching in the template. Check some samples.  
  
_Sample 1: Changing About me page._  

\>> Search for following text: My Name : Aman Bhattarai  
\>> You can see the whole texts on the above page. Change them, done !  

_Sample 2: Changing Archive Page._  

\>>Search for following text: This is Archive Section
