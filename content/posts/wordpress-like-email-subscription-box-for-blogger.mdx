Few weeks ago, our team had shared <a href="https://www.twistblogg.com/blog/tags/subscription-widgets" rel="nofollow">Stylish Email Subscription Widget</a> v1,v2 and got lot of responses. Today I personally decided to share another version - **Premium WordPress like email subscription box/widget for blogger**. It looks so premium and eye catching, I bet users can't ignore it.  
  
Email Subscription Box plays an integral role in the success of blogs. Users may like the website and wish for contents to be delivered in a safe and fast way. What is the safe and fast way to inform someone? Definitely via Email (Don't think of phone calls ðŸ˜€). The more email subscription users, the better chance for shouting about the content and in turn more traffics.  
  
Blogger provides [Feedburner Email Subscription Box](https://www.twistblogg.com/2015/04/email-subscription-popup-blogger-plugin.html) which is hmm not that much professional and beautiful. But WordPress really has a lot of plugins that undoubtedly provide premium email subscription widget. I was fantasized by the beauty of those widgets and planned to design one for blogger. Here it is, professional wordpress like email box for blogger.

**NOTE:-** You do not have permission to COPY and SHARE my code on your blog. Neither you can remove the Credits given in the CSS comments. CSS comments do not appear on your blog. Neither they provide me any backlink nor they affect your blog in anyway so keep them intact. Respect the hard-work of others'. Play it safe and clean. :)

**BONUS:-** I have included a backlink in the bottom of subscription box and you can remove it simply from the HTML part if you wish to. Choice is yours! My blogger widgets are always neat and clean, just all what you need.

_Important Note: I've used font-family:inherit in the code. Thus this email subscription widget makes use of default font family of the template. Doing so improves page speed. But the widget mayn't align properly. Do change the height:308px section to maintain the widget height!_
