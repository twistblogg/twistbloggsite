**Blogger Search Preferences Settings** is a cool feature to optimize our blogger blog with best ever settings to [get higher rankings in SERPs](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/03/seo-top-5-link-building-methods.html). This feature has given a new power to bloggers to optimize their blogs in a better way than before like as Custom URL Redirect, Custom 404 Error Page, [Meta Description](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/01/How-To-Add-Meta-Tags-To-Blogger-Posts.html), Custom Header Tags and Custom Robots.txt so overall these are cool features unless we do not use them. Let us begin to optimize our blog and use these settings for best ever SEO results.  
  

## Steps For Blogger Search Preferences Settings


First of all  go to Blogger Settings then Search Preferences Settings.

  
#### 1) Meta Description:   


First option is Blog Meta Description where we will put our Blog's description (Let it be empty if you are already using meta description tags in your template code).  
  
Click on edit link and write a brief description of your blog no more than 155 characters because it will be ignored by search engines after that particular limit.

#### 2) Custom Page Not Found:  


Second option is creating our own Custom 404 error page instead of showing the odd message, `"Sorry, the page you were looking for in this blog does not exist"`. This is a separate tutorial Covered Here, "[Creative 404 Error Page Setup For Blogger](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/03/creative-404-error-page-setup-for-blogger-blog.html)".

  

#### 3) Custom Redirects:   


Third option is customing redirects which means if there is a link on our blog which no more exist like as a older post you may have deleted, then we can [make a redirect to that URL](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/01/How-To-Redirect-A-URL-To-Another-URL-In-Blogger.html) and can redirect this older link to a newer link on our blog.  
  
You need to enter the URL after **"www.yourdomain.com"** like as **"/2013/03/older-link.html"** (excluding inverted comma) and in same way in new link like as **"/2014/03/new-post"**. Please see the image below.

#### 4) Custom robots.txt:   


Now this is the most sensitive part of our settings. I mean if we use it wrongly, our blog may suffer a great loss like as totally ignored by search engines. So use these settings precisely and carefully as mentioned and shown in image.  
  
Custom robots.txt file content can be updated in here so we will add some important lines to it. Just copy paste the code given below (please remove any existing code if any) and hit save after doing compulsory changes as they are highlighted:


> User-agent: \*     
> Disallow: /search     
> Allow: /   
> Sitemap: https://www.twistblogg.com/sitemap.xml

  

  

#### 5) Custom Header Tags: 


Last option is of Header Tags by which we will make our blog much [more SEO optimized](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/02/top-5-free-seo-testing-tools.html). We will allow our blog to be indexed in a better way so that the content of our blog will appear in SERPs as we have published.  

Otherwise [search engines will index our blog content](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/01/how-to-get-google-to-index-new-blog-site-articles-quickly.html) by default settings like as indexing Archives, search description for our blog posts from Open Directories rather than from our own content and indexing search pages results. Click on Edit - Yes - then mark all the boxes as shown in image below (be careful).
