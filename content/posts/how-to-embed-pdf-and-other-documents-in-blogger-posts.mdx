Did you ever wonder about embedding a PDF file inside your blog post? Well, we are going to learn how anyone can embed their PDF file inside blogger blog post itself so your readers do not have to leave your blog to view a PDF file. This feature might be helpful for a lot of people who share PDF files on their blogs. We can accomplish this task using Google Drive.  
  

  

### What is Google Drive?

Answer: Google Drive is a free file hosting service by Google with 15GB of storage which allow us to host our files for free. Even you can host a website on it too. This is little intro about Google drive and without taking much of your precious time, let us begin the process.  
  
**Note:** I used Google Chrome Browser.  
  
  

### Step 1) Sign-in into your Google Drive Account  


Just use your Gmail address to sign into <a href="https://drive.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Drive</a> Free file hosting service.

#### Changing Width and Height of the Embedded Document


Optional step but important one. By default, the dimensions of the PDF document are set to 640px wide in width and 480px wide in height. If these dimensions do not fit according to your post area, then just change these pixels accordingly to make it appear fit on your blog post. All you have to do is edit its iframe code inside post HTML. See the example below.  


```html
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_PLgWpOK_wTQjNTZTM0bE01Zzg/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
```

You can change width from 640px wide to 600px or 740px wide and do the same to height.
