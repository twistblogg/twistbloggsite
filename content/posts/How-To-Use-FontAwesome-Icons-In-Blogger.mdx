### How To Use These Icons On My Blog?


To use these icons on your blogger blog, you need to edit template just a little. Go to **Blogger → Template → Edit Template → Click Inside Code** ([backup your template code](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/05/how-to-backup-all-blogger-blogs-with-google-takeout.html) before editing by copying code to notepad). Now press Ctrl+f or Cmd+f then search for `<head>` tag and paste the given code below it.  

```js  
<script type='text/javascript'>  
//<![CDATA[  
function loadCSS(e, t, n) { "use strict"; var i = window.document.createElement("link"); var o = t || window.document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; i.rel = "stylesheet"; i.href = e; i.media = "only x"; o.parentNode.insertBefore(i, o); setTimeout(function () { i.media = n || "all" }) }  
loadCSS("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.8.2/css/all.min.css");  
//]]>  
</script>  
<noscript>  
<link href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.8.2/css/all.min.css' rel='stylesheet'/>  
</noscript>
```  

Above code is the CSS stylesheet of FontAawesome icons. Now you can place any icon to appear anywhere with simple `<i>` tag in your HTML e.g. inside `<div>`, `<a>`, `<li>` or `<p>`. See the example below how we used icons in our navigation menu links.  

```html
<li><a href='https://www.twistblogg.com'><i class="fas fa-home"></i>Home</a></li>
<li><a href='https://www.twistblogg.com/contact'><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>Contact Us</a></li>
```

To change/use another icon just replace the icon name in yellow color `<i class='fas fa-home'>` and icon's name are given above every icon here at <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FontAwesome Icons Page</a>. Just replace the icon name in yellow with your choice. 

For example `<i class='fas fa-laptop'>`. See image of few icons with their name highlighted below. First fas remains same and second comes with icon name.

### Customization of Icons With CSS


To customize the color, size, shadow and background, just call the (i) tag in CSS and paint these icons with your creativity. CSS code is given below to simply copy paste and customize. Copy the above code and paste it just before the `]]></b:skin>` code line.  

```css
i {
color:#E2FD18;
font-size:15px;
padding-right:5px;
text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #000;
}
```

This above CSS effect will apply to every icon on your blog. But what if you want to give different color, size, shadow etc. to a specific icon? Do not worry, you know what? These are awesome icons so here is the another hack for you. If you want to give separate effect to a icon than others' then you need to apply style inside the HTML `<i>` tag. Here is example:  

```html
<i class='fas fa-heart' style='font-size:18px; color:red;'></i>
```


 After applying the above style inside the HTML (i) tag, your icon size would be 18px and color red while other remains same as per the effect you applied by CSS to (i) tag. Anytime if anything goes wrong, let us  help you. Thank You.
