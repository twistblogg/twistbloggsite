Actually this is the power to each and every blogger or website owner given by Google via Webmasters Tools.

So this is what we are going to know step by step with examples.  
  

_Please Note: This article is written considering old Webmaster interface._


### Login To Webmasters Tools


To use the webmasters tools you need to <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">login to your webmasters tools</a> account with your gmail account. If you are loged in to your Gmail account, you will automatically be logged in. Now if you are using blogger.com platform then you will see your blog already listed but in case there is no blog listed, just click on **Add A Site** red color button on left side then a dialog box will appear where you need to add the URL of your blog or website for example: **www.twistblogg.com** (do not use **https://** and **www** is must).  
  
In case you are using a Subdomain like as example.blogspot.com or example.weebly.com then you need to enter your subdomain name without www as it is. Incase you are not using Blogger.com blogging platform, you need to verify the ownership of your domain so open the Verify Ownership section then you will see too methods of verifying (Recommended and Alternate) but we suggest you to use the **Alternate method** and **in alternate method select the second option of HTML tag**  to verify in which you will get a [Meta Tag](http://www.twistblogg.com/2014/01/How-To-Add-Meta-Tags-To-Blogger-Posts.html) to insert in HTML of your website/blog.  
  
Copy the Meta Tag code and paste it after the `<head>` section in the HTML of the blog/website and after that click on red **Verify Now** button and you will see a congratulation message saying that your site is verified and added. That is it now you are ready to use the magical features of Google webmasters Tools.  
  
**A Reminder :** I've explained this for old interface. With new interface, you just need to enter your web address in _Inspect any URL_ located at top position.  


#### Click on Your Added Site


After Adding your site successfully it will appear in homepage so click on it to use the inside features. After that on left side you will see a number of useful links and one of them is **Crawl**. Click on it to expand it then click on the **Fetch as Google** link. See the image to understand in a better way.

#### Enter Your Site URL and Click on Fetch Button


After clicking on Fetch as Google link you will get option of entering the URL of your site to fetch as Google. If your site is new and not indexed then you need not to enter any URL just click on Fetch button but if your site is indexed but you want to get your new article/web page indexed then enter the URL of that page.

**Please Note:-** You have to enter the URL starts after **http://www.yourdomain.com/** and not the full URL because your main Domain URL is already entered which is fixed up to **http://www.yourdomain.com/** see the image below.
