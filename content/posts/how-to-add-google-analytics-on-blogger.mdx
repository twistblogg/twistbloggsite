*   As soon as you will accept the terms and conditions, you will be redirected to the page where you will get the **Tracking id** starts with **UA** and a JavaScript code. We need the tracking id only because blogger has its own feature which allow us enter our ID. Avoid JavaScript code.

### 2) Adding Google Analytics To Your Blogger Blog  


This process is of just two steps. First we need to add the Tracking Id we have recently copied and secondly we need to add the code to our template but instead of adding the JavaScript code, we will add a `<include>` Tag which will do the magic of importing Google Analytics Code into our template  automatically on every page of our blog.

*   Go to **Blogger → Settings → Other** and then scroll down to the end.
*   You will see there is an option to add our UA id in "**Analytics Web Property ID**" box so paste your UA tracking id you had copied from Google Analytics account (See image below). Then save these settings and move on to next step.
*   Now go to **Template → Edit HTML** then wait to load the template code box.
*   Click anywhere inside the template code box, press Ctrl+F or Cmd+F so that a search box will appear.
*   Enter `</body>` code line to search box and hit enter. 
*   Just before it, paste this little code line 
    
    ```html
    <b:include name='google-analytics' data='blog'/>
    ```

*   Now save your template code because we are done with the installation process.
