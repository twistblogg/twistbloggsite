We frequently receive questions like :  


*   Can you suggest me a good template?
*   Which is the [best blogger template](https://www.twistblogg.com/2019/09/best-premium-blogger-templates.html) for my blog?
*   I need an SEO optimized blog theme for my upcoming project, can you help please?
*   Are blogger themes comparable to WordPress versions and so on.  



To answer them all at once, we will share 7 [out of Box Blogger template Designs](https://www.twistblogg.com/2020/04/twistblogg-v2-blogger-template.html) for implementing in your blog that will change perspective on how beautiful a blogspot theme can be.

  

### WordPress Vs Blogger Designs

WordPress posses a higher flexibility in custom designs because of support for plugins and page builders. You need [social sharing widget](https://www.twistblogg.com/2020/05/social-sharing-buttons-blogger.html), install a plugin, as simple as that. You need to create a hero header, use page builder websites such as Divi, Beaver which allows you to custom design in a minute.  Also, there are thousands out of box designed pages made available for WordPress sites that will just WOW your mind.  
  
However, the same is not true for Blogger blogspot. There’s no support for plugins. You need to rely on your coding skills for adding extra features. The available Blogger Template Designer really sucks. Also, most of the [premium blogger themes](https://www.twistblogg.com/2016/01/premium-seo-optimized-blogger-template.html) may not meet your expectations.  
  
**So, Shall I migrate to WordPress?** Just wait for a second. I’ve got splendid news. There are some blogspot templates designed so perfectly that they will make you think are they even blogger blog pages. Excited, hah? Let’s check my top 7 out of box blog design list.




## 1) Salbuta Gradient Premium Blogger Theme



Salbuta is a ridiculously responsive out of box blogger theme with a modern grid light & gradient, multi layouts & columns and easily customized design with a well explained documentation. This is by far the best modern blogger theme I've ever seen. Also, there's a [dark mode version](https://www.twistblogg.com/2020/04/add-night-mode-in-blogger-blog.html) of it available. Isn't that cool?

  

The template implements the current design trend of using wavy styles perfectly. You will even get the power to toggle on/off many features. It sounds like a perfect deal for me. Give it a shot and you'll have no regret.

## 3) Mepium - Medium Like Blogspot Theme



Number 3 in our list is Mepium - a medium inspired blogger version.The use of fonts, font size values, spacing of letters and clean layout in Medium.com design is what makes it so special. The same concepts were cloned and a medium based blogger template was released namely Mepium.

  

Mepium looks elegant, simple and detailed at the same time. It allows visitors to read contents without any distractions. The only thing I found missing is Medium based Related Post Widget, which might be added in near future. So, if you are searching for the closest clone version of Medium for blogger, Mepium is the best one available.
