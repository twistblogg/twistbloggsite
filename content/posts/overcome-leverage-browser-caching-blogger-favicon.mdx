**A favicon** is a small image file that represents your website in an address tab or when users bookmark your page. For bloggers, the default address for favicon is : **webpageadress/favicon.ico** .  
  
You might have noticed favicon is a .ico format image file. Does that mean other image formats like png, jpeg, gif not supported for favicon? Most modern browsers support these formats, however browsers like internet explorer only supports .ico as favicon. Therefore, it is a [good practice to include all image formats](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/02/top-5-must-do-seo-things-before-publishing-your-articles.html). 

Do people still use IE? -- I'll leave that upto you.  
  
**At minimum, favicons need to be 16x16 pixels**. Though I strongly suggest to include 32x32 and 48x48 versions as well. That way, if users drag their bookmarks to desktop or bookmark from mobile, the favicon will stretch, giving it a clean look.  
  
Now, you have some information on favicon, let me go straight to the problem faced by bloggers with favicon. It was few days back, I was analyzing my blog in <a href="https://www.gtmetrix.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GTMetrix</a> and I saw leverage browser caching problem had some impact on my [blog Pagespeed](https://www.twistblogg.com/2019/11/lazy-load-images-in-blogger.html). When I clicked the tab, there was an issue: **Leverage Browser Caching For Favicon (1 Day)**.

## How to solve favicon leverage browser caching issue in blogger?


The solution is simple. We will convert favicon to Base64 format. Why base64? Because favicons are tiny image files and encoding with base64 formats  can reduce HTTP Request. There are downsides too: <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11736159/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-base64-encoded-images">Learn more here about base64 format</a>.  


In this process, we will upload a .png format for supported browsers and .ico for unsupported ones. Be sure you have both formats with you.  
  

1.  Go to <a href="https://www.base64-image.de/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">base64-image.de</a>.
2.  Either **drag or drop** your _.png favicon_ or press "**Or Click Here**".
3.  Once conversion is made, you can see a successful green color. Click on **Show code** and leave the browser tab open for sometime.

4.  Now, go to Blogger.com > Theme > Edit HTML and Search for favicon.ico. If you found matching query, delete that otherwise skip this step. Don't forget to [backup your whole blog](https://www.twistblogg.com/2014/05/how-to-backup-all-blogger-blogs-with-google-takeout.html) before proceeding.
5.  Search for `<head>` and paste the following code below it.
  
```html
<link href='replace_with_your_base64_address' rel='icon' type='image/x-icon'/>
```
